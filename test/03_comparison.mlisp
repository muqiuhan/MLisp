;; Test: Equality
(== 5 5)          ;; Expected: #t
(== 5 6)          ;; Expected: #f
(== 0 0)          ;; Expected: #t
(== -1 -1)        ;; Expected: #t

;; Test: Inequality
(!= 5 6)          ;; Expected: #t
(!= 5 5)          ;; Expected: #f
(!= 0 1)          ;; Expected: #t

;; Test: Less than
(< 5 10)          ;; Expected: #t
(< 10 5)          ;; Expected: #f
(< 5 5)           ;; Expected: #f
(< -5 0)          ;; Expected: #t

;; Test: Less than or equal
(<= 5 10)         ;; Expected: #t
(<= 10 10)        ;; Expected: #t
(<= 10 5)         ;; Expected: #f

;; Test: Greater than
(> 10 5)          ;; Expected: #t
(> 5 10)          ;; Expected: #f
(> 5 5)           ;; Expected: #f

;; Test: Greater than or equal
(>= 10 5)         ;; Expected: #t
(>= 5 5)          ;; Expected: #t
(>= 5 10)         ;; Expected: #f

;; Test: Comparison chains
(< 1 (+ 2 3))     ;; Expected: #t
(> (* 3 4) (+ 5 5))   ;; Expected: #t
