;; Simple macro tests

;; Test 1: Very simple macro that just returns a quoted value
(defmacro test-simple ()
  (quote 42))

(define result (test-simple))
(print result)

;; Test 2: Macro that uses list to construct code
;; Note: This requires proper quote/unquote handling which we'll implement later
;; For now, let's test if macros are being recognized and expanded

(print "Basic macro test completed")
